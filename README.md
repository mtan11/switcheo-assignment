# Switcheo Code Challenge

## Problem 1: Three ways to sum to n

- Kindly review the file in the problem1/3ways-sum-to-n.ts.

## Problem 2: Fancy Form

- I've created a ReactJS project to address this problem.
- Please refer to the README.md file in the problem2/switcheo-An directory for initial insights during the review.

## Problem 3: Messy React

- I consolidated the code in a single file and provided comments indicating the appropriate folders for each variable.
- Additionally, I performed refactoring on this component for better clarity and maintainability.
